# Most Common Tweet
This Project is a test of the Twitter4J Twitter API to create an app that finds the most common word in a twitter users last 2000 tweets

###Investigation
  As an experiment, we tried to open URL's from tweets that originated from Youtube. This is a lot harder than it seems since Twitter automagically shortens all URL's on the site, but through API trickery it is possible to find the origin link (manually unshortening is a *terrible* idea)
